1. datamodel file contains a model of the data that should be created as a result of all manipulations

2. How to Create KPIs and Measures:

1.Open Power BI Desktop.
2. In the "Model" view, click on "New Measure" in the ribbon.
3. Enter the DAX formula for your measure. For example, copy and paste the DAX formula for "Total Sales" into the formula bar.
4. Press Enter to create the measure.
5. Repeat the process for each KPI or measure you want to create.
6. Drag and drop the created measures into your report canvas to use them in visualizations.

Average of Sales by State =
AVERAGEX (
    SUMMARIZE ( Orders, Orders[state_id] ),
    CALCULATE ( SUM ( Orders[sales] ) )
)

Average Profit by State = AVERAGEX (
    SUMMARIZE ( Orders, Orders[state_id] ),
    CALCULATE ( SUM ( Orders[profit] ) )
)

Total Sales by Customer =
CALCULATE (
    SUM ( 'orders'[sales] ),
    ALLEXCEPT ( 'orders', 'orders'[customer_id] )
)

Total Sales by Customer and Year = SUMX (
        SUMMARIZE (
            'orders',
            'Orders'[order_date].[Год],
            "Total Sales", SUM ( 'orders'[sales] )
        ),
        Orders[Total Sales by Customer]
    )

Total Sales by State =
SUMMARIZE(
    'Region',
    'Region'[id],
    'Region'[name],
    "TotalSales", SUMX(FILTER('Orders', RELATED('State'[id]) = 'Orders'[state_id]), 'Orders'[sales])
